# TFIPAM Provider

A lightweight Terraform provider for managing IP address pools and allocations. The TFIPAM provider lets you declare and manage IP pools, allocate and release addresses through Terraform, and persist configurations to a storage backend (default: file). It is intended for simple IPAM workflows and automation in local or small-scale environments.

Features
- Create, update, and delete IP pools and prefixes
- Allocate and release individual IP addresses with predictable, idempotent behavior
- Configurable storage backend (file-based storage by default)
- Simple schema and minimal external dependencies — ideal for local development and CI workflows

Quick example
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tfipam = {
      source = "cthiel42/tfipam"
      version = "1.0.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "tfipam" {
  storage_type = "file"
  file_path    = ".terraform/ipam-storage.json"
}

resource "tfipam_pool" "example" {
  name = "pool_example"
  cidrs = [
    "10.0.0.0/16",
    "10.5.0.0/24"
  ]
}

resource "tfipam_allocation" "example_0" {
  id            = "allocation_example_0"
  pool_name     = tfipam_pool.example.name
  prefix_length = 24
}

resource "tfipam_allocation" "example_1" {
  id            = "allocation_example_1"
  pool_name     = tfipam_pool.example.name
  prefix_length = 27
}
```

Allocation resources provision CIDRs from the pool based on a greedy search and are stored in the `allocated_cidr` field. Data calls can also be used to read this information about allocations.

Data Call Example
```hcl
data "tfipam_allocation" "example" {
  id        = "allocation_example_0"
  pool_name = "pool_example"
}
```
